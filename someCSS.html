	<p style="font-family: Arial">Drake has been performing hits for the past 12 years. Since his days in 2006 when he dropped his mixtape So Far Gone, which had great songs including "Best I Ever Had" and "Successful," he has been a star. Drake gained popularity from not only this mixtape, but also his time on Degrassi: The Next Generation. Drake has been killing the game forever, and it seems like he has no intentions of slowing down anytime soon.</p>

	<p style="font-family: Cambria">On every track Drake hops on, you know it's going to be good. Whether he is rapping like in "Weston Road Flows" or singing like in "Fire & Desire," it's going to make you feel either very happy or in your feelings. That's another great thing about Drake, he has a pretty big range. When it comes to his music he can go from talking about gangs such as in "100" ft. The Game, or he can come up with a song like "Marvin's Room" where you are left thinking about your ex. Drake overall has a great voice and with his witty lines, and relatable stories, it makes him one of the greatest artists of our generation.</p>
